# AI Generated ZSH Completions

I love zsh completions. Everyone hates generating them.

Let's see if AI can do this for us.

## Installation

```shell
zinit light iloveitaly/zsh-ai-completions
```

## How Well Does This Work?

My main goal was replacing [zsh-completion-generator](https://github.com/RobSis/zsh-completion-generator) which is abandoned and does not work with usage information that is not generated by a specific python CLI library.

I've checked the AI generated completions against this tool and it works quite well!

### Prompt

```
generate zsh completion. Only return the shell script contents (no other output) without a markdown block.

write a zsh completion. This content contains subcommand --help output.

write a zsh shell script to execute each subcommand help output and aggregate it so an llm could easily generate a completion from it. Only return the shell script contents (no other output), without a markdown block. Do not use "commands" as a variable name in the script.
```

Example:

```
fzf --help | llm? "generate zsh completion. Only return the shell script contents (no other output) without a markdown block." > completions/_fzf
```

## TODO

- [ ] the company behind sqlc has a way to run code securely in the cloud, should try this for subcommands
- [ ] nested subcommands? best way to handle?
